    <h1>Rapix Connect Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025 April 28</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Rapix Connect. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>RAPIX CONNECT LIMITED</strong> ("we," "us," or
      "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in relation to our Rapix Connect software application (the
      "<strong>App</strong>"), available via web browser, desktop application, and mobile Progressive Web App (PWA), and
      our website <a href="https://rapixconnect.com" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">https://rapixconnect.com</a> (the "<strong>Website</strong>").</p>

    <p>Rapix Connect provides a communication platform designed to facilitate real-time communication between registered
      General Practitioner (GP) surgeries and Community Pharmacies in the UK regarding medication availability and
      related queries.</p>

    <p>This policy applies to registered users of the App (staff at GP surgeries and Pharmacies) and visitors to our
      Website.</p>

    <p>For the purpose of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, the data
      controller is:</p>

    <p>
      <strong>RAPIX CONNECT LIMITED</strong><br>
      Registered Office: 55 Manor Road, Stretford, Manchester, England, M32 9HT<br>
      Company Number: 16152849
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

    <h3>Information You Provide Directly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GP Surgery Users:</strong> Full practitioner name, associated GP Surgery name, GP Surgery address, and
        the practitioner's NHSmail address (used for registration and login verification).</li>
      <li><strong>Community Pharmacy Users:</strong> Pharmacy name, Pharmacy address, and the Pharmacy's organisational
        NHSmail address (used for registration and login verification).</li>
      <li><strong>Medication Request Data:</strong> Details of medications being queried (e.g., drug name, strength,
        form, quantity).</li>
      <li><strong>EPS Barcodes:</strong> Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) barcodes associated with specific
        medication requests. These are used solely as a unique reference identifier within the App to link
        communications to a specific prescription event between the relevant GP and Pharmacy. We do not use the EPS
        barcode to access or retrieve patient-identifiable information within Rapix Connect, nor is it intended for use
        by the receiving party <em>within our App</em> to look up patient details. Its purpose is strictly for reference
        regarding the communication thread.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Data:</strong> Messages exchanged between GP Surgeries and Pharmacies via the App's chat
        feature.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g., via email or phone), we will receive
        your contact details and the content of your message or inquiry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about how you use the App, such as the types of
        requests made, frequency of use, and interaction patterns. This data is primarily used to generate aggregate
        statistics (see Section 3).</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> When you access the App or Website, we may automatically receive
        technical information, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (which may be logged by our servers or
        sub-processors like Cloudflare and Supabase for security and operational purposes), basic device information,
        browser type, and details regarding your interaction with our service. We do not actively use this for tracking
        individual behaviour beyond operational necessities.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> We use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to manage authenticated sessions after
        successful login via NHSmail one-time codes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information and Legal Basis</h2>

    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes, relying on the specified legal bases under UK GDPR:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To Provide and Operate the Rapix Connect Service:</strong> Processing user details, medication request
        data, EPS barcodes, and communications to enable the core functionality of the App â€“ connecting GPs and
        Pharmacies for medication availability queries.<br>
        <em>Legal Basis:</em> <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (to provide the service requested by users) and, for
        paying GP Surgeries, <strong>Performance of a Contract</strong>.
      </li>
      <li><strong>To Authenticate Users:</strong> Using NHSmail addresses and one-time codes (via our sub-processor
        Supabase) to verify user identity and secure access to the App.<br>
        <em>Legal Basis:</em> <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (to ensure the security and integrity of the service
        and restrict access to authorised healthcare professionals).
      </li>
      <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> Responding to your inquiries, providing support, and sending
        service-related notifications.<br>
        <em>Legal Basis:</em> <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (to respond to user requests and manage the service
        relationship).
      </li>
      <li><strong>For Audit and Service Integrity:</strong> Retaining records of completed requests and communications
        for audit trails and potential dispute resolution.<br>
        <em>Legal Basis:</em> <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (to maintain accurate records of service usage and
        ensure accountability).
      </li>
      <li><strong>To Calculate Aggregate Statistics:</strong> Processing usage data (which may initially be
        identifiable) to calculate anonymized, aggregate statistics about service usage (e.g., average number of
        requests per GP/month, average response times). These statistics do not identify individual users or
        organisations.<br>
        <em>Legal Basis:</em> <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (to understand service usage patterns, improve the
        service, and for business intelligence).
      </li>
      <li><strong>For Security and Protection:</strong> Using technical information (like IP addresses processed by
        Cloudflare) to protect against DDoS attacks, fraud, and other security threats.<br>
        <em>Legal Basis:</em> <strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (to protect the security and availability of our
        service).
      </li>
      <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> Processing data where required by applicable law or
        regulation.<br>
        <em>Legal Basis:</em> <strong>Legal Obligation</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected,
      including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chat Contents:</strong> Chat message history within a specific conversation thread is automatically
        deleted 90 days after the last message was sent in that thread.</li>
      <li><strong>Request Completion Data:</strong> Information related to completed medication requests (including
        medication details and the associated EPS barcode reference) is retained for audit and aggregate analytics
        purposes. We retain this data for as long as necessary for these purposes, subject to your data protection
        rights (see Section 8). You can request the deletion of your organisation's data at any time (see Section 8).
      </li>
      <li><strong>User Account Information:</strong> We retain your account information (name, email, organisation
        details) for as long as your account is active. If an account is deactivated or deleted upon request, we will
        remove the associated personal data in accordance with our internal procedures, unless retention is required for
        legal or audit purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregate Statistics:</strong> Data used for aggregate statistics is anonymized and therefore may be
        kept indefinitely as it no longer constitutes personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Between Registered Users:</strong> The core function of the App involves sharing information
        (practitioner name/organisation name, medication details, EPS barcode reference, messages) between the GP
        Surgery initiating a request and the Pharmacy(ies) receiving/responding to it, and vice-versa.</li>
      <li><strong>With Service Providers (Sub-processors):</strong> We engage third-party companies to help us operate
        and provide the App. These sub-processors have access to your information only to perform tasks on our behalf
        and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. Our key sub-processors include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Provides authentication services (processing NHSmail addresses for login).
            Their privacy policy and data processing terms apply.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> Provides security services (DDoS protection, CDN), which involves processing
            IP addresses. Their privacy policy and data processing terms apply.</li>
          <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> Hosts the desktop application update manifests and files. Minimal data
            processing (potentially IP logs).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other
        legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) investigate,
        prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement
        agencies; (b) enforce our agreements with you; (c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party
        claims or allegations; (d) protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (e) exercise or protect the
        rights and safety of Rapix Connect, our users, personnel, or others.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization,
        bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify
        you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
        information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregate Data:</strong> We may share anonymized, aggregate usage statistics, which cannot reasonably
        be used to identify you or your organisation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>

    <p>Our primary servers are located within the United Kingdom. However, some of our sub-processors (like Supabase and
      Cloudflare) may process data in locations outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA). When we transfer
      personal data outside the UK/EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual
      Clauses (SCCs) approved by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) or the UK GDPR adequacy regulations, to
      protect your data.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>

    <p>We implement technical and organisational measures designed to protect your personal data from unauthorised
      access, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Secure login using one-time codes sent to verified NHSmail addresses.</li>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS). 
        Our database data is encrypted at rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to personal data within our organisation is restricted to authorised
        personnel (currently the company founders) who need access to perform their job functions.</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure Security:</strong> Use of Cloudflare for DDoS protection and network security.</li>
      <li><strong>Signed Updates:</strong> Desktop application updates are cryptographically signed to ensure
        authenticity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we strive to protect your personal data, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the
      absolute security of your information.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights (UK GDPR)</h2>

    <p>Under UK data protection law, you have rights including:</p>
    <ul>

      information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child without
      verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>10. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Website:</strong> Our public-facing Website (https://rapixconnect.com) does not use cookies or other
        tracking technologies for analytics or advertising.</li>

        technologies strictly necessary for its functionality, such as managing your login session (e.g., storing JWTs)
        and remembering user interface preferences. These are not used for tracking user behaviour across different
        services.</li>
    </ul>
