      <h1>Rapix Connect Accessibility Statement</h1>

      <p><strong>Date of publication:</strong> 2025-09-20</p>
      <p><strong>Next review:</strong> Annual</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Rapix Connect web and mobile applications. Rapix Connect is committed
        to ensuring digital accessibility for GP surgeries and community pharmacies. We are continually improving the user
        experience for everyone and working towards compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
        Level AA.</p>

      <h2>Compliance Status</h2>
      <p>Rapix Connect is currently partially compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA. This means that some parts of the product
        do not fully meet the accessibility standard. We have implemented responsive layouts across devices, alt text for
        images, and partial keyboard navigability. High contrast text and full keyboard navigation are on the roadmap.
        Formal accessibility testing against WCAG 2.1 Level AA is planned as part of our user acceptance testing (UAT)
        process.</p>

      <h2>Non-accessible Content</h2>
      <p>The following aspects of Rapix Connect are not yet fully accessible:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High contrast text – work in progress.</li>
        <li>Full keyboard navigability – work in progress.</li>
        <li>Formal screen reader testing – scheduled as part of future accessibility testing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are actively working to resolve these issues.</p>

      <h2>Preparation of this Statement</h2>
      <p>This statement was prepared on 2025-09-20. It will be reviewed annually or sooner if there are significant
        changes to the product or accessibility standards.</p>
